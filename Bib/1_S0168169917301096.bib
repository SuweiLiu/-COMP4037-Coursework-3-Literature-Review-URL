abstract = {An automated method for maize and weed detection is very important to efficiently remove weeds and precisely calculate the quantity of maize. Color features were used in this study to investigate a simple maize-detection method using a color machine-vision system. Conventional image segmentation methods based on RGB values cannot separate maize from weeds because of the highly similar image RGB values of these plants. Thus, a post-processing algorithm was developed to distinguish maize from weeds after image preprocessing. Color indices were used to develop a classification model. The nine optimal features were selected by principal component analysis to reduce the effect of illumination. Finally, support vector data description was used as a classifier to differentiate maize from the mixes of different species of weeds. Pictures were taken by a commercial camera and used to verify the stability of the algorithm. Results show that the overall accuracy for three years is 90.19%, 92.36% and 93.87%, respectively. And the color indices used in this work were stable under various weather conditions and over time.}
